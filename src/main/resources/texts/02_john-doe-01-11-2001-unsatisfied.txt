Operator: Hello, how may I help you ?
Customer: Hello, I'm John. I need to share a problem with you. Actually, the insurance has reimbursed only half the money I have spent due to the accident.
Operator: Hello John, could you please give me your last name so that I can find your contract.
Customer: Sure, my surname is Doe.
Operator: And last thing, I need to know the date you were born.
Customer: Yes, so I was born in 2001, actually during the first day of November.
Operator: Great, I see your contract now. Actually, the full reimbursement option has been cancelled automatically by our system. This explain the half reimbursement.
Customer: Ah damn, this is not acceptable. I've not even been notified about this automatic change.
Operator: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that but the full reimbursement option was free for one year and at the time of subscription you were not interested in automatic renewal.
Customer: I don't discuss that. The important fact is that I should have been notified.
Operator: Sure, I understand your resentment. The best I can do is to inform my manager.
Customer: OK, let's do that. Good bye.
Operator: Good bye. And again let me apologize for the issue.
