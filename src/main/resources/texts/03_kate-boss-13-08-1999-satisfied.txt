Operator: Hello, how may I help you?
Customer: Hello, I am currently at the police station because I've got an accident. The police would need a proof that I have an insurance. Could you please help me?
Operator: Sure, could you please remind me your name and birth date?
Customer: Of course, my name is Kate Hart and I was born on August the thirteen in the year nineteen ninety nine.
Operator: I'm sorry Kate, but we don't have any contract in our records.
Customer: Oh, I'm sorry that I've made a mistake. Actually, my last name is not Hart, but Boss. It changed since I'm married.
Operator: Indeed, I have now found your contract and everything looks good. Shall I send the proof of insurance to the police station?
Customer: Oh, if possible, my husband will go directly to your office in order to get it.
Operator: Yes, that's possible. I will let the paper at the entrance. Your beloved could just ask it to the front desk.
Customer: Many thanks. That's so helpful. I'm a bit more relieved now.
Operator: Sure, you're welcome Kate. Please come back to us any time in case more information is needed. Bye.
Customer: Bye.
